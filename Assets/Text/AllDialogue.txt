Hello employee, I am going to cut to the chase. It has come to my attention that 
your behavior has been making other employees feel unsafe. More
importantly, some believe that you might not be one of us. Considering 
this, you must understand the situation you’re in.
We cannot let one of their kind live among us, let alone survive. 
Of course, if you are one of us, there is nothing to fear.
I will simply ask you a few questions. Unless otherwise directed, 
you will simply answer “yes” or “no”.  Answer truthfully
and we will be done in no time. Do you understand?

Very well, let us proceed.

Interesting... I can't believe you just don't understand what I just told you. If you think being funny will help your situation, you are wrong. Let us proceed before I lose my temper.
